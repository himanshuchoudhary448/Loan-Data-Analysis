<h1><b>PROJECT BRIEF</b></h1><br>
<p><h2><i>Business Understanding</i></h2><br>
You work for a <b>consumer finance company</b> which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, 
the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:<br>
<ul><li>If the applicant is <b>likely to repay the loan</b>, then not approving the loan results in a <b>loss of business</b> to the company</li><br>
<li>If the applicant is <b>not likely to repay the loan</b>, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a <b>financial loss</b> for the company</li><br>
</ul></p>
<p><div>The data given contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is 
likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.</div>
<h2><i>Business Objectives</i></h2>
<p>The company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. If one is able to identify the <b>risky loan 
applicants</b>, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of <b>credit loss</b>. <b>Identification of such applicants using EDA</b> is the aim of this Project. Thus, The 
company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its
portfolio and risk assessment.</p>
